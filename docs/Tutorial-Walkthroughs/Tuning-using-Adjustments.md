# Tuning using Adjustments

:::note
The **Adjustments** tab is not implemented yet in RF2. the page will be updated once it is implemented again.
You can still setup adjustment functions using [**CLI**](https://github.com/rotorflight/rotorflight/wiki/Rotorflight-2-CLI-Changes#adjustment-functions) commands.
