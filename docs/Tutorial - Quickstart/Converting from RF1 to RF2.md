# Converting from RF1 to RF2

:::caution
It is really important that a Rotorflight 1 backup/dump file is not loaded to the Rotorflight 2 controller.   
:::

Backing up the hardware
There have been a huge number of changes between versions of Rotorflight. The backup/dump file is not compatable with the new version. Ultimately this means all of the tuning and configuration has to be done again starting from the Rotorflight 2 defaults. If you have already done custom remapping these can be transferred by using the dump hardware and saving this to a file.
