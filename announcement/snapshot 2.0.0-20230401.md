Lots of development time has gone into Rotorflight-2 (RF2). Most features in the firmware have been rewritten, with the knowledge learned from Rotorflight-1. The firmware has been upgraded to the BF4.3 level. Numerous issues have been fixed.

The development is continuing strong. The firmware is now receiving only minor updates, but the Configurator and Blackbox development is gaining speed.

New snapshots should arrive biweekly or so.

Happy flying!
